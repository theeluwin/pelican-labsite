An academic lab website builder based on [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/).

It manages and updates the site by treating the `*.md` files in `/src/content/data/` (that is, the articles) as a kind of structured data.

Key features:

* Home (index)
    * recent headlines
    * recent publications
* About
* Members
    * list of current or alumni members
    * **relevant publications for each member**
    * **relevant lectures for each member**
* Projects
    * **relevant publications for each project**
* Publications
    * per year, type
    * **automatic link of members for each author**

Inspired by [IDS Lab.](https://ids.snu.ac.kr){:target="new"} and [theeluwin.github.io](https://theeluwin.github.io){:target="new"}, which are also my works.
